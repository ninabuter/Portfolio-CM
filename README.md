# Portfolio Analysis: Beyoncé's Music

Assignment for the course Computational Musicology of the study Musicology at the UvA. In this assignment, I analyzed the musical characteristics of Beyoncé's albums and specific songs with the Spotify Web API. I chose to do this analysis because Beyoncé is one of my favourite artists, and I was curious which musical features are mainly present in her music.

With the Spotify Web API, you can obtain musical features from music on Spotify. Musical features include **danceability**, **energy**, **key**, **liveness**, **loudness**, **mode**, **speechiness**, **tempo**, **time signature**, and **valence**.
I created the portfolio via R Markdown.
